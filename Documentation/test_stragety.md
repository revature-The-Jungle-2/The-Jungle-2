# Branching
- From Main, there are two branches - Java Master (Java) and Python Master (pythonMaster). 
- Main should only be committed to for documentation edits or during the final merging for the presentation. 
- Team members branch from and merge to their respective Master branch to ensure that there are no merge conflicts with each individual language before merging into Main. 
- It should be clear at a glance either A) who is working on that branch and/or B) what feature the branch is for.

# General Links
Link to Working RTM : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Wd62-HARALNNptBiyKsMwXIYKXT7Z_LJ7mNnJBOjFo/edit?usp=sharing
- When the code is frozen, the RTM will be downloaded and added to the in-repo documentation.

# Best Practices
The usual.
Get some sleep.
Take breaks.
Communicate with your teammates.
Pet cats and touch grass.

- Make sure to commit your branches before logging off so nothing is lost!
- If you have merge conflicts that you cannot figure out, reach out ASAP.
